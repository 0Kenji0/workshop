#### Install NodeJS
- Deploying the backend on AWS is made seamless with Amazon EC2, a cornerstone of AWS services. Here are some of its standout features:
- Amazon EC2 functions like traditional virtual or physical servers but offers rapid initialization, flexible resource scaling, and simplified management.
- By virtualizing physical servers into multiple virtual instances, it maximizes hardware resource utilization.
- Amazon EC2 supports a wide range of workloads, including web hosting, application deployment, database management, authentication services, and virtually any task a conventional server can handle.
